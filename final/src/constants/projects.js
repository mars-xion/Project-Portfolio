Bauhaus is one of the pioneers and first schools of industrial design and is a great symbol of who I am as a media designer. It also represents my love for discovering history and art as a hobby. In these sketches, I included Bauhaus-inspired geometrical shapes in my photo and navigation bar. Another source of inspiration shown in the sketches is my latest project an interactive art that creates a drawing of a human body outline.",
